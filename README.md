1. Project Overview:
"This project is an online cab booking system, similar to popular apps like Ola and Uber. The main goal is to help users easily book a cab by entering pick-up and drop locations."

2. Functionalities:
 Users can register and log in (role-based login: Admin, Customer, Driver).
 Customers can book cabs by giving pick-up and drop locations.
 The system will fetch available drivers nearby and assign the most suitable one.
 It also calculates estimated time and fare for the ride.
 Drivers can view and update their ride status.
 Admins can manage users, bookings, and view reports.

3. Technologies Used:
I used Spring MVC for building the controller layer and managing the application flow.
Hibernate is used for ORM mapping between Java classes and the database.
JSP and Servlets handle UI and form processing.
JDBC is used for login authentication and basic DB operations.
MySQL is used as the database.
The application is deployed on Apache Tomcat Server.

4. Tools Used:
Eclipse IDE (or any), MySQL Workbench, Postman for testing APIs, Apache Tomcat for deployment.

5. Why I Chose This Project:
"I chose this project to get hands-on experience in real-time application development and understand how enterprise-level web applications are built using Java full-stack technologies."
