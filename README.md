1. Project Overview:
This project is a Role-Based User Management System designed to control access to different parts of a web application based on user roles like Admin, Teacher, and Student. The main objective is to create a secure and organized system where each user can only access the features permitted for their role.

2. Functionalities:
Users can register and log in with role-based access (Admin, Teacher, Student).
Admin can manage all users: create, update, delete, and assign roles.
Teacher can view student data, manage courses or subjects (as applicable).
Student can view their own profile and academic information.
Each role has dedicated dashboard and restricted access to unauthorized pages.
Implements session handling and secure login using JDBC authentication.
Uses basic validation and alerts to improve user experience.

3. Technologies Used:
Java (Core + J2EE) – for business logic and backend development
JDBC – for direct interaction with the MySQL database (no Hibernate)
MySQL – as the relational database for storing user and role data
JSP (Java Server Pages) – for dynamic UI generation
HTML & CSS – for front-end design and styling
Servlets – for handling requests and managing application flow
MVC Architecture – separates logic into Model, View, and Controller for cleaner structure

4. Tools Used:
Eclipse IDE – for developing and managing the Java project
MySQL Workbench – for creating and managing the database
Apache Tomcat Server – for deploying and running the web application

5. Why I Chose This Project:
I chose this project to gain hands-on experience with core Java web technologies and to understand how role-based security is implemented in real-world applications. It helped me practice the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, database operations using JDBC, and creating a basic user management system without relying on advanced frameworks like Spring or Hibernate. This project gave me solid experience in full-stack Java development using standard technologies.
